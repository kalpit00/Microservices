E-commerce Microservices Architecture Project

1. Backend - Spring Boot 3 + MySQL
2. Frontend - Angular
3. Deployment - Docker + Kubernetes
4. Security - KeyCloak for Oauth2.0

Project follows a complete industry grade approach, starting from a Monolothic architecture, breaking it down into different microservices for scalability

1. Three individual microservices : Product, Order and Inventory, which serve as Rest Endpoints
2. An API-GateWay to centralize traffic from the web
3. An Oauth2 security layer using KeyCloak for User registration and authentication
4. Integrated Backend with an Angular Frontend app for a minimalistic GUI

Tools used :
1. Databases : MySQL and MongoDB
2. IDEs : IntelliJ Idea Ultimate 2024, Visual Studio Code
3. Testing + Deployment : Postman, Docker Desktop, K8s

Complete project was containerized and Docker images were built, pushed to Docker Hub and deployed to K8s
